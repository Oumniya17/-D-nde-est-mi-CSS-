# 🧩 Where’s My CSS?

> “Oh no! 🙀 We accidentally deleted the CSS of our login page!”  
That’s how the adventure started… and this repo is the happy ending.

## 🎯 The Task

This project was part of a **Visual Studio Code exercise** called  
**“Where’s my CSS?”**.

The challenge:  
- We were only given the **HTML of the `<body>`** — no CSS at all.  
- Our mission was to **rebuild the entire original design** of a login page from scratch, using only our memory, design intuition, and color picker tools.  
- The final page had to **look just like the reference image**, keeping all structure and class names the same (no editing the HTML!).
  
  <img width="628" height="614" alt="Untitled" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50a613be-883a-409a-846d-5635a375b282" />

🧠 Tools allowed:
- Visual Studio Code 💻  
- CSS (written manually, of course)  
- ImageColorPicker 🎨 to extract the exact colors from the reference screenshot

## 💪 What I Did

- Recreated all the original styles from the missing CSS file 🧵  
- Centered the login card perfectly using Flexbox  
- Styled the Google and Facebook buttons to match their real-world colors  
- Added soft shadows, round corners, and clean typography  
- Made sure all spacing and alignment matched the original design  
- Linked the `styles.css` file properly in the `<head>`  
- Organized the project neatly for upload to GitHub

In short: I brought the lost CSS **back to life** ⚡

## 🌈 The Result

A modern, centered login card with:
- Gradient background  
- Social login buttons  
- Clean “or” separator  
- Polished input fields and call-to-action button  

Basically… **the lost CSS has been found** 🕵️‍♀️💫

## 🧠 Lesson Learned!

Even when your CSS disappears, your *developer instincts* don’t.  
Always separate structure (HTML) from style (CSS) — and don’t forget to save your files 😅
